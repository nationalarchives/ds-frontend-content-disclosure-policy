*The National Archives Responsible Disclosure Policy*

We take the security of our systems seriously, and we value the security community. The responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security and privacy of our users.


*Guidelines*

The National Archives does not encourage security research against its systems or services. In the event that vulnerabilities are discovered, we require that all researchers:

* Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems, and destruction of data;
* Use the communication channel below to report vulnerability information to us; and
* Keep information about any vulnerabilities you have discovered confidential between yourself and The National Archives until we have had 90 days to resolve the issue.

If you follow these guidelines when reporting an issue to us, we will:

* Not pursue or support any legal action related to your research;
* Respond to completed reports within 72 hours of submission;
* Recognise your contribution on our Disclosure Acknowledgements webpage if you give consent, are the first to report the issue, and we make a code or configuration change based on the issue.


*Out of scope*

In the interest of the safety of our users, staff, the Internet at large and you as a security researcher, the following test types are excluded from scope:

* Findings from physical testing such as office access (e.g. open doors, tailgating)
* Findings derived primarily from social engineering (e.g. phishing, vishing)
* UI and UX bugs and spelling mistakes
* Network level Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) vulnerabilities

Things we do not want to receive:

* Personally identifiable information (PII)
* Credit card holder data


*How to report a security vulnerability?*

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our services, please inform us by emailing: security-alert@nationalarchives.gov.uk.

Please include the following details with your report:

* A description of the specific location and potential impact of the vulnerability;
* A detailed description of the steps required to reproduce the vulnerability (proof-of-concept scripts, screenshots, and compressed screen captures are all helpful to us).
* If you give consent for us to publish your details on our Disclosure Acknowledgements webpage, clearly say so and provide your name and/or handle.

We are not able to offer bug bounties. We will only respond to reports where vulnerability details are disclosed.
